This repository holds the code-product of an image classification project that was conducted as part of the course TTK4852 Experts in Team - Machine Learning.

The project builds on the Kaggle Chest X-ray competition which can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia

To replicate this project:

1. Data needs to be downloaded from the website provided above
2. Your chosen Data directory needs to be updated at the top of /modules/preprocessing.py
3. /modules/test_cnn.py can be run for 8 different model configurations, by simply altering the argument inside the call to main() at the bottom of the script
4. If one desires, a visual classification example can be generated by calling the show_classification_examples() with the preferred model name as input.
5. In addition, a visualization of a models performance on the test set in the form of a confusion matrix is possible by simply providing a model name to check_model_confusion_matrix()
